# Lets-get-arrested project

In Japan, a schoolgirl was caught by the police for writing an endeless loop of alert in JavaScript like this:

        <script>
          while (1) {
            alert("   ∧＿∧ ﾊﾞﾊﾞﾊﾞﾊﾞ\n"+
                  "　(　･ω･)＝つ≡つ\n"+
                  "　(っ　≡つ＝つ\n"+
                  "　/　　　) \n"+
                  "( /￣∪ \n"+
                  "何回閉じても無駄ですよ～ｗｗ\n"+
                  "m9（＾Д＾）プギャー！！\n"+
                  "　byとりさん（@TypedTypelessTy）");
          }
        </script>
